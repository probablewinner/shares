Description : “Scruples is a corpus and benchmark for studying descriptive machine ethics, or machines' ability to understand people's ethical judgments. Scruples offers two datasets: the Anecdotes and the Dilemmas. 
The Anecdotes collect real-life experiences with ethical judgments about them, while the Dilemmas present pairs of simpler actions with crowdsourced judgments on which is less ethical.”
