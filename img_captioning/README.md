Description : “Automatic image captioning, the task of automatically producing a natural-language description for an image, 
has the potential to assist those with visual impairments by explaining images using text-to-speech systems. 
However, accurate image captioning is a challenging task that requires aligning, exploiting, and pushing further the latest 
improvements at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing fields.” (from Google's Conceptual Captions )
